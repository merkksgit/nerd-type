# NerdType

NerdType is a fast-paced, minimalistic typing game designed to help you improve your typing skills while having fun with language learning. The game challenges you to type programming-related vocabulary as well as basic English, Swedish, and Finnish words before your energy runs out. With each correct word, you restore energy and get closer to hacking the Pentagon!

This project began as a school assignment but has evolved into an ongoing journey of learning and improvement. As I progress in my studies and expand my development skills, I continue to implement new features and refinements. Each update represents not just an improvement to the game, but also reflects my growing expertise in web development.
