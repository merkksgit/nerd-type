# NerdType

This project is a **minimalistic typing game** developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (with Bootstrap for styling). The game challenges the user to type the correct words within a time limit, with the possibility of gaining extra time for each correct word.

## Features

- **Timer-based gameplay**: Players must type a randomly chosen word before time runs out. Each correct word adds extra time.
- **Dynamic word generation**: The game picks a random word from a predefined word list in each round.
- **Score tracking**: The total time spent in the game is displayed.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Bootstrap to ensure a smooth experience across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To structure the game interface.
- **CSS (Bootstrap)**: For responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles game logic, such as timers, word checking, and user input.

## How to play

1. Click the Start button to begin the game.
2. Type the word displayed in the input field before the time runs out.
3. For every correct word, additional time is added to the countdown.
4. The game ends when time runs out, and the page automatically reloads to restart.
