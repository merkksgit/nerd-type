                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                  NerdType is a minimalistic typing game, where coding and
                  language learning come together! Developed using JavaScript,
                  HTML, and CSS, this game challenges you to type the correct
                  words within a time limit. You'll sharpen your typing skills
                  with programming vocabulary, as well as basic English,
                  Swedish, and Finnish words. For every correct word, you gain
                  extra time to keep the challenge going. Get faster, get
                  accurate, and have fun along the way, happy typing!
                </p>
                <h4>Features</h4>
                <p>
                  In this fast-paced typing game, players must type randomly
                  selected words before their energy runs out. Each correctly
                  typed word restores some of the player's energy, keeping them
                  in the game. The objective is to continue typing without
                  depleting energy, ultimately leading to a successful "hack" of
                  the Pentagon. The game pulls words from a predefined list in
                  every round, adding variety to each session. When you finish a
                  game, your results are saved directly in your browser's local
                  storage. This means that your scores will remain available
                  even if you refresh the page or close the browser. For the
                  best experience, it's recommended to play with a keyboard
                  rather than a mobile device. Built with Bootstrap, the game
                  ensures a responsive and smooth experience across all screen
                  sizes.

                <h4>How to play</h4>
                <p>
                  To begin the game, choose a game type from the navigation bar
                  and click the Start button or press Enter. You’ll need to type
                  the displayed word into the input field before your energy
                  runs out. Each correctly typed word will restore some of your
                  energy. The game ends when you either run out of energy or
                  successfully complete the hack. Once the game concludes, hit
                  the return button to play again. You can also click the Reset
                  button or press 'Control + Enter' at any time to reset the
                  game manually.
