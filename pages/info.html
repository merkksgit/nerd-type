              <h4>2. The Philosophy Behind NerdType</h4>
              <hr
                class="mb-3"
                style="
                  border-color: #ff9e64;

              />
              <p>
                Many aspects of life and work require muscle memory to achieve
                true efficiency and flow. Whether you're coding, studying,
                writing, or managing daily tasks, your typing skills form the
                foundation of your digital productivity. Fast and accurate
                typing isn't just about speed – it's about reducing the friction
                between your thoughts and their expression.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you can type without thinking about individual keystrokes,
                your mind is free to focus on higher-level concerns: solving
                complex problems, crafting better code architecture, or
                expressing ideas more clearly. Poor typing skills create a
                bottleneck that slows down your entire workflow, interrupting
                your train of thought and breaking your concentration.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is why I created NerdType – to provide an engaging way to
                develop the muscle memory and precision that makes everything
                else easier. In programming, every function call, variable name,
                and code comment benefits from fluid typing. In academic work,
                note-taking and essay writing become less burdensome when your
                fingers can keep pace with your thoughts. In professional
                environments, emails, documentation, and presentations flow more
                naturally when typing isn't a conscious effort.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal isn't just to type faster, but to type with such
                natural precision that it becomes an extension of your thinking
                process. NerdType combines practice with purpose, using real
                words from multiple languages and programming contexts to build
                skills that directly apply to your work and studies.

              <p>
                In NerdType, your typing speed is measured in Words Per Minute
                (WPM). Here's how the WPM is calculated:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The game tracks the time elapsed from your first keystroke
                  until the game ends. This time is converted from milliseconds
                  to minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The game counts the total number of characters you typed
                  correctly in all words, including longer words which
                  contribute more characters to your total.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The standard word length is defined as 5 characters, which is
                  the international standard for typing speed measurements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your WPM is calculated by dividing your total characters typed
                  by 5 (to convert to standard words), then dividing by the
                  elapsed time in minutes.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                For example, if you typed 200 characters correctly in 1 minute,
                your WPM would be:
              </p>
              <p>
                (200 characters / 5 characters per word) / 1 minute = 40 WPM
              </p>
              <p>
                This means typing longer words will contribute more to your WPM
                than shorter words. For example:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Typing "programming" (11 characters) counts as 2.2 standard
                  words
                </li>
                <li>
                  Typing "cat" (3 characters) counts as 0.6 standard words
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The WPM calculation only considers correctly typed words and
                does not account for any errors or incorrect words.

              <h4>6. How Accuracy is calculated</h4>
              <hr
                class="mb-3"
                style="
                  border-color: #ff9e64;
                  opacity: 1;

              />
              <p>
                In NerdType, your typing accuracy is measured as a percentage of
                correct keystrokes. Here's how the accuracy is calculated:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The game tracks every character you type (excluding backspace
                  and special keys) from your first keystroke until the game
                  ends.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When you type a character, it's counted as correct only if it
                  matches the corresponding character in the target word at that
                  exact position.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The game maintains two counts:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Total keystrokes: Every character you type</li>
                    <li>
                      Correct keystrokes: Characters that match the target word
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your accuracy is calculated by dividing correct keystrokes by
                  total keystrokes and converting to a percentage.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                For example, if you typed 20 characters and 16 of them were
                correct, your accuracy would be:
              </p>
              <p>
                (16 correct keystrokes / 20 total keystrokes) × 100 = 80%
                accuracy
              </p>
              <p>Here's how accuracy works in practice:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If the target word is "code" and you type "cade", you will
                  have 4 total keystrokes, 3 correct keystrokes (c, d, e),
                  resulting in 75% accuracy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you type "coxde" and then backspace to fix it to "code",
                  you will have 5 total keystrokes (c, o, x, d, e), 4 correct
                  keystrokes (c, o, d, e), resulting in 80% accuracy.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The accuracy calculation includes all characters typed, even if
                you later correct them with backspace. This encourages precise
                typing rather than rapid typing-and-correcting.

              <p>
                In NerdType, your score is calculated using a sophisticated
                formula that considers your typing performance and the game's
                energy settings. Here's a detailed breakdown:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Base Score:</strong> The core of your score is
                  calculated with: (WPM × 10) × (accuracy² as decimal) ×
                  difficulty multiplier
                  <ul>
                    <li>WPM (Words Per Minute) measures your typing speed</li>
                    <li>
                      Accuracy is squared to heavily reward precision typing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The difficulty multiplier adjusts based on game mode and
                      settings
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Precision Bonus:</strong> Additional points for
                  consecutive perfect words
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Tracks words typed without any mistakes (precision streak)
                    </li>
                    <li>Bonus starts after 5 consecutive perfect words</li>
                    <li>2% of base score per perfect word after the 5th</li>
                    <li>Streak resets to 0 when any typing mistake is made</li>
                    <li>Applied to base score only, not energy bonus</li>
                    <li>No cap - longer streaks always reward more points</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Difficulty Multiplier:</strong> A dynamic calculation
                  based on game energy settings
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Total Words: More words needed increases the multiplier
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Bonus Energy: Less bonus energy increases the multiplier
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Initial Energy: Less initial energy increases the
                      multiplier
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Classic Mode (30 words needed) serves as the baseline
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Multiplier ranges from 0.5 to 2.0, dynamically responding
                      to game settings
                    </li>
                    <li>Custom settings generate an appropriate multiplier</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Energy Bonus:</strong> A small bonus is awarded for
                  remaining energy
                  <ul>
                    <li>Bonus = min(remainingEnergy × 5, baseScore × 0.2)</li>
                    <li>
                      This is capped at 20% of your base score to keep it
                      balanced
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Final Score:</strong> Base Score + Precision Bonus +
                  Energy Bonus
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                This scoring system ensures that your results are comparable
                across different game modes and difficulty settings. Players are
                primarily rewarded for typing skill (speed and accuracy), with
                appropriate adjustments for the challenge level chosen.
